Official implementation of **RACE**. 

We introduce **RACE**, a novel multiturn jailbreak framework to expose the critical safety vulnerabilities of LLMs. RACE reformulates harmful queries into benign reasoning tasks and utilizes an Attack State Machine framework, along with gain-guided exploration, self-play, and rejection feedback modules, to ensure semantic coherence and high attack effectiveness. Our experiments on multiple LLMs demonstrate that RACE achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, highlighting the potential risks in current LLM safety mechanisms.
